A simple command-line game where you try to guess the outcome of a rolled dice. Perfect for practicing basic programming and having some fun!

2. You guess what number the dice will show.
3. If your guess is correct, you win!
4. If not, you can try again or quit.

## Features

- Random dice roll simulation
- User input for guesses
- Tracks attempts
- Simple, beginner-friendly code

## Example Code (Python)

```python
import random

def guessing_dice_game():
    print("Welcome to the Guessing Dice Game!")
    attempts = 0
    while True:
        dice = random.randint(1, 6)
        guess = input("Guess the dice roll (1-6) or 'q' to quit: ")
        if guess.lower() == 'q':
            print("Thanks for playing!")
            break
        attempts += 1
        if int(guess) == dice:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed correctly in {attempts} tries.")
            break
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The dice showed {dice}. Try again.")
